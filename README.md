# Hotpot üç≤

Authy / Google Authenticator for the command line.

Hotpot is a simple and secure command-line tool for managing TOTP-based two-factor authentication codes. Hotpot securely stores your 2FA secrets in your system's keyring and generates time-based one-time passwords when you need them.

This was largely vibe-coded, so use at your own risk!

## Features

- üîí Secure storage using system keyring
- üïí TOTP (RFC 6238) code generation
- üíª Simple command-line interface
- üóÇÔ∏è Interactive dashboard with real-time codes and search
- üì± QR code export for easy mobile app setup

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --path . --locked
```

## Usage

### Add a new account

```bash
hotpot add <account-name>
```

You will be prompted to enter the Base32 secret securely.

Example:
```bash
hotpot add github
Enter the Base32 secret: ********
```

### Interactive Dashboard

Just run `hotpot` to open the interactive dashboard where you can:
- View all your TOTP codes in real-time
- See a progress bar showing when codes will refresh
- Press [F] to search accounts using fuzzy matching
- Use up/down arrows to navigate
- Press Enter to copy code to clipboard
- Press [A] to add a new account
- Press [D] to delete the selected account
- Press [E] to export QR code for the selected account
- Press 'q', 'Esc', or Ctrl+C to exit

### Generate a single code

```bash
hotpot code <account-name>
```

Example:
```bash
hotpot code github
```

### Delete an account

```bash
hotpot delete <account-name>
```

### Export QR Code

You can export a QR code for an account either through the dashboard (press [E]) or using the command:

```bash
hotpot export-qr --name <account-name>
```

This will display a QR code in the terminal that can be scanned by authenticator apps.
