# Hotpot üç≤

Authy / Google Authenticator for the command line.

Hotpot is a simple and secure command-line tool for managing TOTP-based two-factor authentication codes. Hotpot securely stores your 2FA secrets in your system's keyring and generates time-based one-time passwords when you need them.

This was largely vibe-coded, so use at your own risk!

## Features

- üîí Secure storage using system keyring
- üïí TOTP (RFC 6238) code generation
- üíª Simple command-line interface
- üóÇÔ∏è Easy account management with fuzzy search

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --path . --locked
```

## Usage

### Add a new account

```bash
hotpot add <account-name>
```

You will be prompted to enter the Base32 secret securely.

Example:
```bash
hotpot add github
Enter the Base32 secret: ********
```

### Generate a code

```bash
hotpot code <account-name>
```

Example:
```bash
hotpot code github
```

### List and search accounts

```bash
hotpot list
```

Interactively search for accounts using fuzzy matching. Type to filter accounts in real-time, use up/down arrows to navigate, and press Enter to generate the code for the selected account. Press 'q', 'Esc', or Ctrl+C to exit.

### Delete an account

```bash
hotpot delete <account-name>
```
